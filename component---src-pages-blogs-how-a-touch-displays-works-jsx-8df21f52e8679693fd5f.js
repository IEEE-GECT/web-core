When you touch the screen with your finger, it acts as a third electric line and interacts with the existing electric field. This interaction induces a weak electric current that travels through your finger and back to the phone, thus altering the charge in the affected nodes."),a.createElement("p",null,"The phone's microprocessor relies on voltage measurements along the second layer to determine which part of the screen is being touched. The changes in charge caused by your finger's interaction with the nodes allow the microprocessor to identify the precise location of the touch.
