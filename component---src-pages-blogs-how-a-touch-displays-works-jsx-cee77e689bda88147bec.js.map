In this blog post, we'll delve into the fascinating world\n        of touch screen technology and explore how your body chemistry plays a\n        crucial role in its functioning. Join us as we uncover the hidden layers\n        and nodes that make touch screens come alive!\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        When you interact with a touch screen, you're not just tapping on a\n        glass surface. The touch screen of a smartphone consists of several\n        layers, including a protective insulating glass exterior and an LCD\n        screen that displays the content. However, we often overlook the layers\n        sandwiched in between.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Among the intermediate layers, one is lined with rows of conducting\n        material, while another features columns of conducting material. These\n        layers are separated by a thin insulating layer, and when aligned, they\n        form a grid of nodes. Let's explore the significance of these nodes in\n        the touch screen's functionality.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3 className=\"SubHeading\">Capacitors and Electric Fields</h3>\n      <p>\n        The phone's battery draws electrons along the first layer, resulting in\n        the accumulation of electrons at each node. This accumulation creates a\n        small electric field, with the nodes acting as capacitors by storing\n        charges. Now, here's where your body chemistry comes into play.\n      </p>\n      <img\n        src=\"https://ik.imagekit.io/0ta3q23cu/blogs/human_water.jpg?updatedAt=1685775072628\"\n        alt=\"touchscreen\"\n        className=\"blogImage\"\n      />\n      <p>\n        As an excellent conductor, your body constantly transmits electric\n        currents due to its high water content and ions with a net electric\n        charge. When you touch the screen with your finger, it acts as a third\n        electric line and interacts with the existing electric field. This\n        interaction induces a weak electric current that travels through your\n        finger and back to the phone, thus altering the charge in the affected\n        nodes.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The phone's microprocessor relies on voltage measurements along the\n        second layer to determine which part of the screen is being touched. The\n        changes in charge caused by your finger's interaction with the nodes\n        allow the microprocessor to identify the precise location of the touch.\n        However, certain scenarios, such as water splattering on the screen or\n        wearing insulating gloves, can disrupt this process.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        While capacitive touch screens dominate the smartphone industry, it's\n        worth mentioning resistive touch screens. These screens comprise two\n        layers: a flexible top layer, often made of plastic, and a rigid bottom\n        layer, usually glass. Both layers are coated with a conductive material\n        and separated by a thin gap. When pressure is applied, completing the\n        electric circuit, the voltage changes, and the touch is detected.\n        Resistive touch screens find applications in industries, ATMs, and other\n        settings that demand durability.\n      </p>\n\n      <h3 className=\"SubHeading\">Conclusion</h3>\n      <p>\n        Understanding the inner workings of touch screens can truly deepen our\n        appreciation for the technology we use daily. Capacitive touch screens,\n        driven by the interaction between your body's electric currents and the\n        screen's nodes, enable seamless navigation and interaction on our\n        smartphones. Next time you swipe or tap on your screen, remember the\n        science that makes it all possible!\n      </p>\n      <div className=\"sources\">\n        <h3 className=\"MiniSubHeading\">Read more</h3>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yU5kPoc7sL4&ab_channel=BRIGHTSIDE\">\n              {\" \"}\n              Brighside Youtube Channel\n            </a>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            {\" \"}\n            <a href=\"https://www.technoarete.org/common_abstract/pdf/0/v6/i1/Ext_13290.pdf\">\n              {\" \"}\n              Touch Screen Technology, IFERP journal{\" \"}\n            </a>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </div>\n\n      <p className=\"ClosingQoutes\">\n        We hope this blog post has sparked your curiosity, just as the nodes on\n        the screen come alive when touched.
